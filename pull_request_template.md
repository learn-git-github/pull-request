Tell a little more about you

Add a [markdown file](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in the folder called `signatures` telling a little more about yourself. 

Only pull requests inside the folder `signatures` will be accepted. 

To suggest edits in the [tutorial](https://github.com/learn-git-github/pull-request/blob/main/signatures/README.md) about a pull request, open an [issue](https://github.com/learn-git-github/pull-request/issues).

- [ ] I followed the suggested format
- [ ] I didn't use offensive words
- [ ] I didn't delete any files
